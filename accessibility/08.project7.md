![animted](https://github.com/caperaven/training/blob/master/images/accessibility/project7.gif)

For this project you will need to create two buttons. The first button will open up a dialog which includes text only. The second button will open up a dialog with a search field.
The aim of this project is to get you familiar with rollover tabs and how focus moves from one instance to another.
                
## Project Details

You will need to set up the project as follows:
1. When opening the dialog, focus should be on the first item that can be focused.
1. The search input has no visible label, but the screen reader should read what is in the placeholder text.
1. Once the dialog is closed focus should be on the item that opened it.
1. Please use correct html elements and syntax
