# Layout Project
Because we deal with forms and user input a lot, we should know how to correctly set up controls for accessibility. 
In the project, you will need to set up a simple form with a submit button. You should be able to navigate the form with only the keyboard using the standard keys. 
The screen reader should also guide the user through the form.
