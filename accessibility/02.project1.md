This project will get you started off and familiarised with articles and some basic semantics.
1. Get started with creating articles.
1. Get familiar with semantics and grouping elements correctly.

## Project details
![example image](https://github.com/caperaven/training/blob/master/images/accessibility/project1.jpg)

This image represents a typical example of how articles are laid out. You will need to use basic html semantics and simple styling.
1. The screen reader should describe what is shown in the image. 
1. You should be able to navigate the screen reader shortcuts, ie navigate all headings or links.
1. Bonus: There is a flaw with one element in the design that is commonly used. I want to see who can find it and how you go about fixing it. If you use the screen reader to navigate, you should pick this up
